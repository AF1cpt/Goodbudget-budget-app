Introduction
GoodBudget is a mobile financial management tool that helps users track their expenses, record income, and maintain personal budgets. The app allows users to create an account and then log daily transactions (both expenses and incomes) in an intuitive interface. With GoodBudget, users can monitor their overall financial health at a glance, including total balances and spending across different categories, and develop better budgeting habits. The application’s goal is to empower users to take control of their finances by providing clear insights into where their money goes and how it aligns with their budget goals.
